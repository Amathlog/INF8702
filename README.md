# INF8702
Practical work for INF8702 - Advanced Computer Graphics

You can found the source code (given by Polytechnique Montr√©al) for the four practical works done during the semester

There is also the source code of the project for the class.

It's a water simulation, with heightmap algorithm, in order to cause disturbance in water and its propagation. The algorithm use shaders and texture writing.

It also contain a 3D viewer coded from scratch (some part were already coded such as shader parsing).

It was coded with C++ and OpenGL and is compatible with Windows and Linux (MacOX was not tested but *should* work)

It covers :
- Texturing
- Refraction
- Camera manipulation
- Disturbance and wave propagation
- Shader programming
